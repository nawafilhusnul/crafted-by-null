# 🌊 From Ocean to Code: My Personal Portfolio

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Husnul Nawafil, an Ocean Engineer turned Backend Developer who found that diving into code is just as exciting as exploring the deep blue sea!

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This portfolio is built with some seriously cool tech:

- ⚛️ **React** - Because who doesn't love components?
- 💙 **TypeScript** - Making JavaScript feel like a well-behaved student
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** - For that pixel-perfect, responsive goodness
- ✨ **Framer Motion** - Adding some pizzazz with smooth animations
- 🌓 **Dark Mode** - Because we all have a dark side

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Want to run this locally? Here's how:

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/nawafilhusnul/personal-website.git

# Jump into the directory
cd personal-website

# Install the goodies
npm install

# Fire it up! 🔥
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Features

- 🎭 **Dark/Light Mode** - Switch between themes faster than I switched careers!
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** - Looks great on everything from a phone to a cinema screen
- 🌈 **Animated UI** - Smooth transitions that would make butter jealous
- ⚡ **Fast Loading** - Because ain't nobody got time for slow websites
- 🎨 **Modern Design** - Clean, minimal, and easy on the eyes

## 🎨 Color Scheme

Our color palette is inspired by the ocean depths (get it? 🌊):

- Primary: Indigo/Purple gradient (like a sunset over the sea)
- Light Mode: Soft grays (like morning mist)
- Dark Mode: Deep grays (like the mysterious deep)
