# 🌊 From Ocean to Code: My Personal Portfolio

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Husnul Nawafil, an Ocean Engineer turned Backend Developer who found that diving into code is just as exciting as exploring the deep blue sea!

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This portfolio is built with some seriously cool tech (or should I say, these are the waves I'm surfing on 🏄‍♂️):

- ⚛️ **React** - Because who doesn't love components? They're like LEGO for web dev!
- 💙 **TypeScript** - Making JavaScript feel like a well-behaved student
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** - For that pixel-perfect, responsive goodness
- ✨ **Framer Motion** - Adding some pizzazz with smooth animations
- 🌓 **Dark Mode** - Because we all have a dark side (like the Mariana Trench!)

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Want to dive into this project? Here's how to navigate these waters:

```bash
# Clone this bad boy (like finding a new coral reef!)
git clone https://github.com/nawafilhusnul/personal-website.git

# Jump into the directory (dive deeper!)
cd personal-website

# Install the goodies (like preparing your scuba gear)
npm install

# Fire it up! 🔥 (or should I say, make waves! 🌊)
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Features

- 🎭 **Dark/Light Mode** - Switch between themes faster than I switched careers!
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** - Flows smoothly like water across all devices
- 🌈 **Animated UI** - Smooth transitions that would make butter jealous
- ⚡ **Fast Loading** - Faster than a submarine with a rocket booster
- 🎨 **Modern Design** - Clean as the pristine waters of the Maldives

## 🧪 Technical Deep Dive

Like exploring ocean depths, this project has multiple layers:

### 🌊 Frontend Architecture

```typescript
// Type-safe components, because bugs in the ocean are scary enough!
interface ProjectProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  techStack: Technology[];
  demoUrl?: string;
  githubUrl: string;
}

// Theme management with context, like controlling the tides
type Theme = "light" | "dark";
```

### 🐠 Performance Features

- **Code Splitting**: Chunks load like schools of fish - efficiently and on-demand
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed like a deep-sea creature
- **CSS Optimization**:
  - PurgeCSS for production
  - Tailwind JIT for development
  - As streamlined as a dolphin! 🐬

### 🌊 Animation System

- **Framer Motion**: For silky-smooth transitions
- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-based animations
- **CSS Transforms**: Hardware-accelerated for peak performance

### 🏗️ Project Structure

```
personal-website/
├── src/
│   ├── components/     # Where the magic happens (like coral reefs!)
│   ├── context/        # Theme management and other brain stuff
│   ├── styles/         # Making things pretty (like sea anemones)
│   └── types/          # TypeScript type definitions (my safety buoys)
├── public/            # Static assets living their best life
└── package.json       # The ship's manifest
```

## 🎨 Color Scheme

Our color palette is inspired by the ocean depths (get it? 🌊):

- Primary: Indigo/Purple gradient (like a sunset over the sea)
- Light Mode: Soft grays (like morning mist over calm waters)
- Dark Mode: Deep grays (like the mysterious abyss)
- Accent Colors:
  - Success: #10B981 (like healthy seaweed)
  - Warning: #F59E0B (like a safety buoy)
  - Error: #EF4444 (like a red tide alert)

## 🔧 Development Practices

Following best practices like following ocean navigation rules:

- 📏 **ESLint & Prettier**: Keeping code tidy like a well-maintained ship
- 🧪 **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Because type safety is like a life jacket
- 🎯 **Git Flow**: Branching strategy smoother than ocean currents
- 📦 **Semantic Versioning**: Navigating versions like charting sea routes

Built with 💙 by Husnul Nawafil, who went from calculating wave forces to calculating Big O notation, and found out that both kinds of debugging require diving deep! 🤿
